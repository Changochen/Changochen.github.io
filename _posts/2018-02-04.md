Yesterday I played the Codegate CTF 2018 with Lotus-Eur3kA, a combination with Blue-Lotus and Eur3kA. Unluckily, there are several challenges we didn't solve in time and finally we got rank 21.

This is the first arm exploit I solved in a CTF game. Actually, the exploit in arm is almost the same with that in X86. All we need to know is how arm makes function calls.  
```bash
[*] '/home/ne0/Desktop/codegate/melong/melong'
    Arch:     arm-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x10000)
```
